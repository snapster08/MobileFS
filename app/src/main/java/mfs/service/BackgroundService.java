     * thread where UI operations take place for Activities running in the
     * same process.  You should always avoid stalling the main
     * thread's event loop.  When doing long-running operations,
     * network calls, or heavy disk I/O, you should kick off a new
     * thread, or use {@link AsyncTask}.</p>

     * @param intent  The Intent supplied to {@link Context#startService},

     *                its process has gone away, and it had previously returned anything
     *                except {@link #START_STICKY_COMPATIBILITY}.
     * @param flags   Additional data about this start request.  Currently either
     *                0, {@link #START_FLAG_REDELIVERY}, or {@link #START_FLAG_RETRY}.
     * @param startId A unique integer representing this specific request to
     *                start.  Use with {@link #stopSelfResult(int)}.
     * @return The return value indicates what semantics the system should
     * use for the service's current started state.  It may be one of the
