     * Called by the system every time a client explicitly starts the service by calling

     * <p/>
     * <p>For backwards compatibility, the default implementation calls
     * {@link #onStart} and returns either {@link #START_STICKY}
     * or {@link #START_STICKY_COMPATIBILITY}.
     * <p/>
     * <p>If you need your application to run on platform versions prior to API
     * level 5, you can use the following model to handle the older {@link #onStart}
     * callback in that case.  The <code>handleCommand</code> method is implemented by
     * you as appropriate:
     * <p/>
     * {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/app/ForegroundService.java
     * start_compatibility}
     * <p/>
     * <p class="caution">Note that the system calls this on your
     * service's main thread.  A service's main thread is the same
     * thread where UI operations take place for Activities running in the
     * same process.  You should always avoid stalling the main
     * thread's event loop.  When doing long-running operations,
     * network calls, or heavy disk I/O, you should kick off a new
     * thread, or use {@link AsyncTask}.</p>
     *
     * @param intent  The Intent supplied to {@link Context#startService},
     *                as given.  This may be null if the service is being restarted after
     *                its process has gone away, and it had previously returned anything
     *                except {@link #START_STICKY_COMPATIBILITY}.
     * @param flags   Additional data about this start request.  Currently either
     *                0, {@link #START_FLAG_REDELIVERY}, or {@link #START_FLAG_RETRY}.
     * @param startId A unique integer representing this specific request to
     *                start.  Use with {@link #stopSelfResult(int)}.
     * @return The return value indicates what semantics the system should
     * use for the service's current started state.  It may be one of the
     * constants associated with the {@link #START_CONTINUATION_MASK} bits.
